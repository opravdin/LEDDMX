LEDDMX is a custom Home Assistant integration for Bluetooth lighting devices compatible with the LED LAMP app, with device names in the format `LED DMX XX-YYYY`.

The integration supports both the **LEDDMX-00** and **LEDDMX-03** models: it auto-detects the variant from the advertised Bluetooth name and selects the matching protocol, so each model gets the correct BLE commands.

## Adding the Device

### Automatic discovery

If your device name starts with `LEDDMX`, Home Assistant should discover it automatically.

You will see a notification in **Settings → Devices & Services**.
